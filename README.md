👋 Hi, I'm Tawanda. I’m a Data Scientist with a twist. I started out as a Chartered Accountant, crunching numbers and managing financial audits. After over a decade in finance, I decided to flip the script and dive into data science. I recently completed Le Wagon’s intensive bootcamp, where I got hands-on with Python, machine learning, and cloud deployment. Now, I'm all about turning messy data into clean, actionable insights that drive real business value.


💞️**What I Bring to the Table**:
    
- **Turning Data into Gold**: Python, SQL, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and visualization — if it involves data, I’m on it.

- **Visualization**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.

- **From Model to Reality**: Skilled in MLOps, deploying models with Docker, FastAPI, and Streamlit, making sure your models don’t just sit there—they work for you.
     

🌟 **Cool Stuff I’ve Built**: A pollution forecasting model with APIs and deployed it on an interactive Streamlit app—bringing data science to life!

  
🎯 **What I’m Looking For**:  I’m all about finding new ways to use data to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s in finance, supply chain, healthcare or any field that could use a data-driven boost.


🎧 **When I'm Off the Clock**: Catching up on the latest sports, spinning some tunes 🎶💿, or on the golf course trying to perfect my swing⛳.
